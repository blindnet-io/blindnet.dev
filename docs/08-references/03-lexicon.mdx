Part of a [Data Capture](#data-capture). A meaningful compound of atomic information units (e.g, data fields of different type, files, and to them associated labels) that are meaningfully captured together.

Examples of situations in which information units are meaningfully captured together include:
- splitting them would introduce an obstacle to making sense of the information that they carry. For example, elements of an address such as street number and street name,
